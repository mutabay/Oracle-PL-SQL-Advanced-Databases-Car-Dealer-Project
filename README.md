# ADVANCED DATABASES TERM PROJECT with ORACLE PL/SQL

Oracle PL/SQL Database Car Store Management 

My coworker and I used Oracle Database to create a project to learn about advanced database capabilities like query optimization, indexing, partitioning, in memory columnar storage, etc.

The fact that I have complete access to everything is the key factor in my decision to choose Oracle Database. It will be a terrific tool once these characteristics are fully appreciated.

I can say that there are inconsistencies in the modeling at the beginning of the project. For Assignment 1, I modeled Bike Dealer Project after the 3rd Assignment Bicycles changed with Cars to put more fields and data.

All queries used and needed throughout the project are in the All Queries.sql file. A little bit of complexity has been solved with comments.

Schema of the Database is here -> [Schema](Database%20Schema.png)
