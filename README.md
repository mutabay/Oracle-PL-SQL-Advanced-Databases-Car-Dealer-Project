# Advanced-Databases-Car-Dealer-Project
Advanced Databases Project using Oracle SQL

The project I made with Oracle Database to understand the features of Advanced Databases such as query optimization, indexing, partitioning, in memory-columnar storage etc.
The main reason I chose Oracle Database is that you have absolutely access to everything. When these features are really understood, they become a miraculous tool.

I can say that there are inconsistencies in the modeling at the beginning of the project. 
For Assignment 1, I modeled Bike Dealer Project after the 3rd Assignment Bicycles changed with Cars to put more fields and data.

All queries used and needed throughout the project are in the ADB_A2.sql file. A little bit of complexity has been solved with comments.
