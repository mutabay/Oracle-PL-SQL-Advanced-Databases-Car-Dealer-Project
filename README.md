Advanced Databases Project using Oracle PL/SQL

My coworker and I used Oracle Database to create a project to learn about advanced database capabilities like query optimization, indexing, partitioning, in memory columnar storage, etc. 

The fact that I have complete access to everything is the key factor in my decision to choose Oracle Database. It will be a terrific tool once these characteristics are fully appreciated.

I can say that there are inconsistencies in the modeling at the beginning of the project. 
For Assignment 1, I modeled Bike Dealer Project after the 3rd Assignment Bicycles changed with Cars to put more fields and data.

All queries used and needed throughout the project are in the ADB_A2.sql file. A little bit of complexity has been solved with comments.
